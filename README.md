# DiveCenter
### Description

The goal of the application is to serve as an information manager about employees and clients, as well as handle course registrations made by clients at the dive center. The app allows registrations to be created, modified or deleted. 

### Main functions:
Add registration:
- A client can register for a course when:
    - there are available places for said course
    - the client has the required experience level
    - the client is over the minimum age requirement
    - If one or more of the conditions above are not met, the registration can not be made.
- Add client/employee/...
- Update registration time:
    - A registration already made, can be modified: the client can change the “time” of the course, but not the type
- View:
    - Details of a registration/client/employee/... with user specified id can be accesed
-Delete:
    - When a registration/client/employee/... is deleted the number of available spots is increased
- View all registrations/clients/employees/...
- View clients with unpaid invoices
- View clients with membership
- View clients by experience level
- View courses sorted by free slots
- View courses sorted by minimum required age

### Objective:

With the application:

- booking courses becomes more simple
- registration errors are eliminated
- employees are guaranteed to work with smaller groups, thus offering services of higher quality
- no time needs to be spent on checking requirements at registration
