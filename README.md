# DiveCenter
### Description

The goal of the application is to serve as an information manager about employees, clients, and sales, as well as handle course registrations made by clients at the dive center. The app allows registrations to be created, modified or deleted both by clients and the center. 

### Main functions:

- A client can register for a course when:
    - there are available places for said course
    - the client has the required experience level
    - the client is over the minimum age requirement
    
    If one or more of the conditions above are not met, an error message will appear.
    
- A registration already made can be modified: the client can change the “time” of the course, but not the type
- A registration can be deleted:
    - by client: number of available spots is increased
    - by employee: course is removed from the clients list too
- A list of all courses with availability can be accessed

### Objective:

With my application:

- booking courses becomes more simple
- registration errors are eliminated
- employees are guaranteed to work with smaller groups, thus offering services of higher quality
- no time needs to be spent on checking requirements at registration
